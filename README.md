# InvoicePro: Invoicing Application

InvoicePro is a mobile invoicing application built with React Native and Expo SQLite, designed to manage invoices and clients efficiently. This project was developed as part of a 12-hour test assignment to create a demoable application with core invoicing features and optional advanced functionalities.

## Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Android Studio or Expo Go for emulator/simulator
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarsTagle/invoicing-app.git
   cd invoicepro
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. Run on an emulator/simulator or physical device:
   - For Android: Press `a` in the terminal or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.
   - For iOS: Press `i` or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.
5. Log in with the mock credentials:
   - Username: `Admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

### Dependencies

- `react-native`
- `expo`
- `expo-sqlite`
- `@react-navigation/native`
- `@react-navigation/stack`
- `@react-native-picker/picker`
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`
- `@expo/vector-icons`

## Time Spent

Total: 12 hours, allocated as follows:

- **Setup and Configuration (1 hour)**: Initialized Expo project, set up React Navigation, and configured SQLite database.
- **Database Design (1.5 hours)**: Created `db.js` with tables for clients, invoices, and items, including soft delete logic using `AsyncStorage`.
- **Core Features (5 hours)**:
  - Invoice Creation Form: 3 hours (form design, validation, item management).
  - Invoice List View: 1.5 hours (list, sorting, filtering, overdue detection).
  - Mark Invoice as Paid/Unpaid: 0.5 hour (status toggle, soft delete).
- **Advanced Features (4 hours)**:
  - Client Management: 3 hours (CRUD operations, pending payment counts).
  - Authentication: 0.5 hours (mock login with `AsyncStorage`).
  - Responsive UI: 0.5 hours (styling adjustments).
- **Testing and Debugging (1.5 hour)**: Ensured functionality across screens and fixed minor bugs.

## Features Completed

### Core Objectives

- **Invoice Creation Form**: Form with autogenerated invoice number, issue/due dates, client selection, item list (name, quantity, unit price), and total calculation. Includes validation for all fields.
- **Invoice List View**: Card-based list with invoice number, client name, due date, total, and status. Supports sorting (by ID, client, status, due date, total) and filtering (All, Paid, Unpaid, Overdue).
- **Mark Invoice as Paid/Unpaid**: Toggle status with visual indicators (green for Paid, red for Unpaid, orange for Overdue). Paid invoices can be soft-deleted.

### Advanced Objectives

- **Client Management**: Create, read, update, and soft-delete clients with validation for names, email, and phone. Displays pending payment counts.
- **Overdue Handling**: Automatic detection of overdue invoices with visual badges and a dedicated filter.
- **Authentication**: Mock login system with `AsyncStorage` for session persistence.
- **Responsive UI**: Cross-platform compatibility with mobile-optimized layouts using `flex` and `KeyboardAvoidingView`.

### Features Not Completed

- **Invoice PDF Export**: Omitted due to time constraints. Plan: Use `expo-print` or `react-native-pdf` to generate downloadable PDFs.
- **Dark Mode**: Not implemented. Plan: Use React Native’s `Appearance` API for theme toggling.

## Thought Process and Prioritization Strategy

### Thought Process and Prioritization Strategy

Given the 12-hour time limit, I focused on delivering a functional invoicing application by prioritizing the core requirements: the Invoice Creation Form and Invoice List View. I started with these features, building `InvoiceFormScreen.js` and `InvoiceListScreen.js` while simultaneously setting up the SQLite database in `db.js` to test data submission early. Once the invoice form was submitting correctly, I added enhancements like form clearing, validation, client name display (first and last name), sorting, filtering, and the ability to mark invoices as Paid/Unpaid, ensuring a robust core experience.

Next, I created a `LandingPage.js` to connect the invoice and client management sections, then implemented full Client Management with CRUD operations in `ManageClients.js`, `CreateClient.js`, `EditClient.js`, and `ViewClients.js`, including sorting and pending payment counts. To preserve data integrity, I used `AsyncStorage` for soft deletes, hiding clients and invoices without permanently removing them, reflecting real-world practices. Finally, I added a mock authentication system in `Login.js` to simulate a secure app. I prioritized these features over PDF export and dark mode to focus on essential functionality and a polished UI within the time constraint.

Trade-offs:

- Used `AsyncStorage` for soft deletes to avoid permanent data loss, simplifying database management.
- Opted for mock authentication to focus on invoicing features.
- Limited item management to adding (no edit/delete) to meet the deadline.

## What I’d Do Next

With more time, I would:

- Add item editing/deletion in the Invoice Creation Form.
- Implement PDF export using `expo-print` or `react-native-pdf`.
- Add dark mode with React Native’s `Appearance` API.
- Enhance authentication with Firebase Auth or a similar service.
- Allow viewing client-specific invoices in `ViewClients.js`.
- Create a cleanup script for soft-deleted records.
- Add more inline comments for maintainability.

## Known Limitations and Bugs

- **Limitations**:
  - Invoice number not displayed in the creation form.
  - No item editing/deletion in the Invoice Form.
  - Soft deletes increase database size; no cleanup mechanism.
  - Mock authentication is insecure for production.
  - Limited testing on tablets/large screens.
- **Potential Bugs**:
  - Sorting may fail if client names are missing.
  - `AsyncStorage` operations lack retry logic.
  - Date picker cancellation may not reset properly.

## Tech Stack Choice

- **React Native with Expo**: Chosen for rapid development, cross-platform compatibility, and access to Expo APIs (e.g., SQLite, DateTimePicker).
- **Expo SQLite**: Lightweight, mobile-friendly database for persistent storage.
- **AsyncStorage**: Used for session management and soft deletes, suitable for a prototype.
- **React Navigation**: Provides seamless screen transitions.
  This stack was selected for its simplicity, speed, and ability to meet the assignment’s requirements within 12 hours.
